## Project Description
This study is about the Post Translational Modifications(PTM) about proteins. Here we are  trying to identify Acetylation sites in proteins, where Acetylation is a kind of Lysine Post Translational Modifications. This is the code repository of my paper entitled "DeepGlut: A Deep Learning Framework for Prediction of Glutarylation Sites in Proteins".

|   __Accuracy__   |   __Precision__   |   __Sensitivity__   |    __AUC__    |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 0.7254           | 0.76              | 0.67                | 0.7585        |

####  performance measurement for 10 fold cross validation

|   __Accuracy__   |   __Precision__   |   __Sensitivity__   |    __AUC__    |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 0.7616           | 0.7267            | 0.8494              | 0.8383        |
